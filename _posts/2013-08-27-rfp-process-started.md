UW Solar has started the RFP process!  A request for proposals, or a RFP, is a solicitation from a company that needs a product and/or a service to potential vendor companies.  These vendor companies will respond with the products they can supply and the price it will cost.  UW Solar will evaluate and choose their vendor based off three points.  First, the overall quality of the vendor.  This means the kilowatt capacity of the system, the lifespan of the system, the interest of the vendor in energy conservation and environmental stewardship, and the company's experience with similar projects in the past.  Second, the willingness of the vendor to participate in educating our students as we collect solar data.  And, third, naturally, their price.  This is the final big push before installation!
