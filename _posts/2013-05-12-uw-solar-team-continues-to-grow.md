_The UW-Solar team is pleased to announce the addition of a new member, Lydia Fulton. Lydia is an undergraduate in UW's Architecture program, and will be assisting both the Siting & Infrastructure and Education & Outreach teams. Her bio will be posted soon. Welcome, Lydia!_

On Thursday, project manager Stefanie Young and team member Casey Rodgers made a presentation to the Campus Sustainability Fund (CSF) to garner approval for our next round of funding. This funding will pay for the actual installation of the solar array and SCADA system. Stefanie and Casey presented to CSF the team's progress, including our priority list of buildings. The team will have another meeting with the Advisory Committee, which includes members of Housing and Food Services (HFS), later this week. We hope to announce the building selection soon, once we discuss our recommendations with HFS.

Meanwhile, the team worked to clarify our mission statement, which now reads:


<blockquote>A multi-disciplinary, student-led research project working to maximize the visibility and potential of clean and renewable solar energy systems to promote awareness, research, and sustainability in our local community.</blockquote>


Check back in the coming weeks for more project updates, including whether we received the next round of CSF funding.
