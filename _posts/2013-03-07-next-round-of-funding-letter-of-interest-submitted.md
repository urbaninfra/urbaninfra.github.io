**We  have submitted the Letter of Interest for the next round of funding for the Campus Sustainability Fund! But first things first, we still have that feasibility study to finish...**


We added a few new team member to the project last week and their bios are now available on The Team page - check it out!Weekly Update:
This week we have begun researching locally made panel systems and have assisted our newly minted electrical engineering team with getting up to speed on the  project.







Additionally, we have started researching the components that make up a grid-tied solar panel installation on a commercial building. There are many components in these types of systems: some are essential and some are not. The Team will decide what elements to include after learning more about the technical details. We are currently exploring alternatives for:



	
  * connections to the fuse box, inverter and micro-inverter, wiring, solar panels;

	
  * emergency shutoff devices, backup switches; and

	
  * general building wiring schematics.
