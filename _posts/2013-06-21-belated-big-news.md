Well hello there!

We know it has been awhile since our last post... The end of the quarter and the beginning of summer always brings busy and exciting times to Seattle. Our team has spent the last several weeks wrapping up classes, graduating, moving to new jobs, starting impressive new internships, AND moving our solar project forward!

Anxious to hear our belated big news? Drum roll please...

**UW-SOLAR HAS BEEN AWARDED FULL FUNDING FROM THE UW CAMPUS SUSTAINABILITY FUND!**

We are so pleased to have received an additional $85,000, which brings our current funding to $89,500. We are so grateful to CSF. Without their support our project could not move forward! Thank you CSF!

Over the last several weeks, we have also solidified our timeline for the remainder of the project and have made a well-received presentation to UW's Design Review Board. We will be moving forward quickly on the design phase of our project and finalizing our education and outreach strategy. Look for more info in the coming weeks.
