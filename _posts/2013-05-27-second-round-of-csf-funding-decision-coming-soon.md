Happy Memorial Day, followers of UW-Solar!

This week, we hope to hear from the Campus Sustainability Fund whether our second round of funding has been approved. The review process took a bit longer than anticipated as there were many worthy projects submitting applications this spring. Last week, we provided some additional information to the review committee and expect their final decision this week.

In the meantime, this is what our team has been working on:



	
  * The Siting and Infrastructure group finalized the feasibility study, including building recommendations. Lydia created a sketch of what the solar array would look like on one of the buildings under consideration.

	
  * The Institutional group is drafting an Operations and Maintenance agreement. This agreement will help insure all the equipment for the array is properly maintained, maximizing our power output over the long term.

	
  * The Information Systems group is continuing to review photovoltaic project specifications in detail.

	
  * The Financing and Policy group is setting up meetings with Washington state module manufacturers. The group is also continuing to develop financial models that take into account a number of factors, such as panel tilt, kilowatt capacity, number of panels, and panel type.


Please check back next week for another update, including (hopefully) news about the results of our funding application.
