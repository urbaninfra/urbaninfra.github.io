Well, we certainly have had a week of beautiful weather here in Seattle and we hope all of you locals had a chance to get outside and enjoy the sunshine!

We will be marking another project milestone this week when Stefanie Young (Project Manager) and Casey Rodgers (SCADA system) present our progress to CSF and request the remainder of our funding - an additional $85,000! We know that the presentation will go well and we hope CSF is pleased with the progress we have made on our amazing solar project!

In other news, here is what we have been up to this week:



	
  * The siting and infrastructure team is finalizing the feasibility study and initial building recommendations are in. We will have a definite ranking by this Thursday!

	
  * The finance, policy, and budget team has contacted installers to determine the costs of various solar panel modules. They also
have been working with them to determine the cost of maintenance annually over the life of the system.

	
  * Additionally, the finance team is modeling benefit-cost and ROI potential. andÂ creating a matrix to evaluate ownership structures and incentives.

	
  * Finally, we have been working to create an additional excel tool to maximize the electrical production and savings based on panel characteristics and roof availability.


Check back in for an update next week!
