We are also proud to announce that we have partnered with the UW Alumni Association to create a dedicated fund for future solar projects at the University of Washington. You can help make more projects like ours possible by donating [here](http://giving.uw.edu/uwsolar).

Thanks to everyone who has made our project possible! Stay tuned as we post on our blog the educational materials we've developed as part of our work.
