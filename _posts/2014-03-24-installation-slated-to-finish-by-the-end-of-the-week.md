After a roof tour done by UW Solar this morning, we have learned that the final module has been placed! That makes a grand total of 128 individual panels on Mercer Court A’s roof. On Wednesday, a commissioning agent will inspect that the system works properly, getting the system one step closer towards producing electricity.  Hopefully by the end of the week the system will be approved and ready to go.

Now the party is slated to be held from 4-5 pm on April 4th.  You don’t want to miss it because there will be some important speakers in attendance!  Also there will be punch and cookies.
