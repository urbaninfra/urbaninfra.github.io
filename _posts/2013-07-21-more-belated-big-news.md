We are proud to announce that UW-Solar has received a matching grant of $50,000 from UW Housing and Food Services, bringing our total funding to $139,500. We are especially thrilled to have received this additional funding, as it will allow us to expand significantly the size of our project. What does that mean? The funding from HFS will go toward additional solar panels, so our array will be able to produce more power, offsetting more of the building's power demands. Our preliminary estimates show that the additional funding will result in 71 percent more power production. Our design is not yet finalized, but we expect our array's capacity to be around 20 kilowatts.

Now that the bulk of our feasibility study is complete, this summer, we will complete the RFP and bidding process. Our target installation date is set for this coming fall. Our Education and Outreach team is in the middle of firming up our strategy, which includes a seminar class for UW students in the 2013-2014 academic year.

Look for more information in the coming weeks!
