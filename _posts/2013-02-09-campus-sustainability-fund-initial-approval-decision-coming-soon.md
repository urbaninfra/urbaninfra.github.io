Last week project managers DC Grant and Stefanie Young presented UW-Solar's project framework and research outline to the [Campus Sustainability Fund](http://http://f2.washington.edu/oess/csf/). This fund was established from an allocation of the funds received by the Student Activity Fee levied on all enrolled students at the University of Washington. Earlier in the academic year, UW-Solar submitted a Letter of Intent to the fund outlining the project proposal and basic elements of our feasibility study. The CSF is now in deliberations regarding our proposal. We hope to hear back regarding their decision next week. If our initial proposal is approved we will continue to work on our feasibility study and will work toward the submission of a more flushed out proposal by mid-April of this year.

Meanwhile, the team has been hard at work on the feasibility study. We are currently involved in on-going outreach efforts with UW's housing and food services staff, developing a decision-tree for location decision criteria, and outlining the SCADA system design.

Wish us luck and check back in next week!
