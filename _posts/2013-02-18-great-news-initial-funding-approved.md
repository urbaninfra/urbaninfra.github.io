_**Great News!**_

_Late last week we received official notice from the Campus Sustainability Fund (CSF) that our initial request for funding had been approved!_ This is great news for UW-Solar as it brings legitimacy to our project that we can begin to leverage for additional funds and donations.

Last week the team held a brainstorming meeting to identify linkages between our goals and the broader goals of CSF:



	
  * Student Leadership and Involvement,

	
  * Education and Outreach,

	
  * Environmental Impact, and

	
  * Feasibility, Accountability, and Sustainability.


Additionally, we discussed the parameters and objectives that we would like to include as part of our proof-of-concept. We are still working on finalizing our criteria for success. Some initial discussions involve continuous versus discrete power, integration into the grid versus stand-alone systems, and the presence of batteries and/or a generator in our system design.

Look for an update next week regarding our specific programmatic objectives and an update on our feasibility report.
