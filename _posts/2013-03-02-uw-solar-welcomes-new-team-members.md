_This week UW-Solar has had some exciting additions to our team. We are pleased to announce that **Allsion McGrath, Nicholas Steckler, Kaiwen Sun, and Sunni Wissmer** have joined our team. Allison joins us from the Evans School of Public Administration and the School of Environmental and Forest Resources. Kaiwen and Nick are both undergraduates in UW's Electrical Engineering program. And Sunni joins us from the Department of Urban Design and Planning's undergraduate Community, Environment, and Planning program._

Now for a project update:

UW-Solar has been working diligently over the past week on the Feasibility Study and coordinating with our internal and external stakeholders. We are currently considering three buildings that were suggested by key stakeholders: Mercer, Lander, and Poplar Halls.

**_Location Criteria_** - We have completed outlining the steps we will take for the location criteria. Our new electrical engineers have reviewed this document and are up to speed on where we are at. We are still working on questions regarding the SCADA system dynamics, but we are beginning to work with the SCADA team to better understand these components.

_**Equipment Specifications**_ - Initial work has been started identifying and creating a matrix of equipment possibilities. We have also started the first pass of researching available solar panel systems.

_**Institutional Framework****s**_ -  We are investigating past projects that have intimately dealt with the university's regulatory process as a student run and solar projects; like, Husky Sustainable Storms, Merrill Hall Building, and the Mechanical Engineering Building. Furthermore, we are looking at the Gift in Place legal agreement other projects have procured. Additionally, we are beginning a process for attaining consensus among stakeholders through forming the Advisory Committee with key stakeholders. We will work with the Advisory Committee to approve a schedule for project phases including draft plan, review, and approval due dates.

_**Finance and Budget**_ - Assessment of UW power usage payment process and operation and maintenance responsibilities for UW Solar project is an integral part of this project. We are consulting internally and externally on how we  will be able to determine the proper information for successful implementation of the solar array.

_**SCADA Systems**___________________________ -__________________________The scada team has been developing parameters for the control and monitoring lab and equipment they will need for the system.
