The cherry blossoms are in full bloom here at the UW campus and that can only mean one thing... It must be almost time for Earth Day!

Come help UW-Solar and the larger UW community celebrate stewardship and sustainability efforts on campus by attending the Huskyfest Earth Day kickoff event in Red Square. We were honored to be asked to exhibit our work with other sustainability leaders on campus. Team members from UW-Solar will be on hand from 10am until 2pm to answer questions you may have about the project or to just say hello. For more information on Huskyfest please make sure to visit [their website](http://www.washington.edu/huskyfest/).
