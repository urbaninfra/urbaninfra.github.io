# About UW Solar

We are  an interdisciplinary team of students at the University of Washington in talks with the UW Housing and Food Services regarding the development of a solar installation with accompanying Industrial Control Systems on buildings at the UW campus. We also are engaged in providing effective outreach to students about the benefits of smart solar investments.

UW-Solar has two objectives:

1. To provide clean and sustainable power production in order to reduce reliance on outside energy resources, improve the resilience of power systems to outages and reduce the overall carbon footprint of the university. Allowing the university to become more self-sufficient in its energy production will reduce direct costs and environmental impact while improving capabilities for community service and rapid recovery during any future crises. The use of clean and renewable energy sources are a primary objective, as stated in the University of Washington’s Climate Action plan, for the future sustainability of the University.

2. Smart infrastructure systems rely upon computerized systems (SCADA) for monitoring and remote control. SCADA systems control water and sewer infrastructure, electrical grids, oil refineries, transportation systems, manufacturing systems, nuclear energy and hazardous chemical production. Historically, such systems were developed in isolation from each other, and were not designed for security and resilience to cyber-attack. The security of these systems on campus is important to UW, and as a model for other campuses, but also cities and regions. This project creates an opportunity for students to lead a project that develops and studies a smart solar energy Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) System.

This website will document the project throughout it’s multiple phases, describe our findings, and education the greater community on the environmental benefit of the solar energy. Furthermore, it will describe the controls system which monitors the system.
