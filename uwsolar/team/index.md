Allison McGrath has been working in the environmental field since 2005, when she interned for the Stewardship department at the Cascade Land Conservancy (now Forterra). Other notable environmental work includes employment by the D.C. Government Affairs and Northwest regional offices of American Rivers. The American Rivers projects seeded her interest in systems thinking, with a focus on water issues. Allison concluded one Northwest office American Rivers project by authoring a published report on case studies examining the efficacy of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act on the ground for designated river segments. She is following up this qualitative work with a quantitative analysis of Wild and Scenic Rivers Act implementation
for her Master’s thesis. Allison jump-started her involvement with alternative energy policy by competing as part of a team in the University of Pennsylvania Fels Institute of Government Policy Challenge. The proposal centered on wastewater treatment plant digesters and WA State biogas market development. Recently, she served as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region 10 Energy and Sustainability Intern, where her written showcases on sustainable EPA projects and her work on Energy Team strategy allowed Allison to learn about and contribute to sustainability at every level of the Agency region. Allison’s education includes a Bachelor’s degree in Biology from Wesleyan University. She is currently pursuing dual Master’s degrees at University of Washington with the Evans School of Public Affairs and the School of Environmental and Forest Sciences, and she serves as Co-President of the Evans School Pi Alpha Alpha Honor Society.

FACULTY ADVISOR:


Jan
Jan Whittington, PhD
Assistant Professor of Urban Design and Planning and Infrastructure, Planning, and Management – College of Built Environments
FACULTY ADVISOR

Professor Whittington’s professional and academic career has been shaped around the need to understand the economic and environmental consequences of investments in infrastructure. Our markets, governments, and quality of life depend on the consistent provision and maintenance of enormous networks of transportation, energy, water, communications, and waste. How we govern the planning, finance, design, and construction of these networks can determine the economic vitality and environmental integrity of our community. Her interest is in reducing the incredible financial and natural cost of these systems to society, while ensuring their capacity to meet the demands for service placed on them by our ever-expanding population. Jan is currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Urban Design and Planning at the University of Washington, Seattle. Her PhD is in City and Regional Planning from the University of California, Berkeley, where she studied transaction cost economics with recent Nobel laureate Oliver Williamson. Prior to her academic career, she spent ten years with infrastructure giant Bechtel Corporation, as a strategic planner and environmental scientist. Professor Whittington’s environmental interests arise from undergraduate degrees in Biology and Environmental Studies from the University of California, Santa Cruz. Her Master’s degree is in City and Regional Planning, from California State University, San Luis Obispo.

UW-Solar would like to offer a special thanks to DC Grant (Masters Infrastructure Planning and Management
and Center for Information Assurance and Cybersecurity) and  (Jonathan Olds (Evans School of Public Affairs and Master of Urban Planning) whose  initial work on this project helped get it off the ground.
