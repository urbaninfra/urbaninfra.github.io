   <p>The Urban Infrastructure Lab (UIL) at the University of
   Washington, under the direction of Professor Jan Whittington,
   brings together students and faculty across numerous disciplines
   with a shared interest in the planning, governance, finance,
   design, development, economics, and environmental effects of
   infrastructure. Collectively, our interests span the systems
   critical to economic and social well-being, such as energy, water,
   health, transportation, education, and communications. Across these
   sectors, our studies integrate empirical and applied methods of
   research to discover the means to obtain long-run objectives, such
   as decarbonization, resilience, and information security, through
   decisions made today.</p>
