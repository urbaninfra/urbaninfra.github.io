  <h1 class="page-heading">Urban Infrastructure Lab</h1>

  <p>The Urban Infrastructure Lab (UIL) at the University of Washington, under the direction of Professor Jan Whittington, brings together students and faculty across numerous disciplines with a shared interest in the planning, governance, finance, design, development, economics, and environmental effects of infrastructure. Collectively, our interests span the systems critical to economic and social well-being, such as energy, water, health, transportation, education, and communications. Across these sectors, our studies integrate empirical and applied methods of research to discover the means to obtain long-run objectives, such as decarbonization, resilience, and information security, through decisions made today.</p>
